A tutorial by Kevin Smith [https://kevinsmith.io/modern-php-without-a-framework]

## Benefit of building a framework

> "Perhaps the biggest benefit you'll find working without a framework is the wealth of knowledge about what's going on under the hood. You get to see exactly what's happening without relying on the framework's magic to take care of things for you in a way that you can't debug and don't really understand."
